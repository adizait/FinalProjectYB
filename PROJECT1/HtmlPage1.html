 1. Don’t let the ball hit the ground without a body hitting the ground with it.
    
 2. The key is not the “will to win”—everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to win that is important. —Bobby Knight
    
 3. Practice does NOT make perfect. Practice makes permanent. PERFECT practice makes perfect.
   
 4. A hard practice makes an easy game.
    
 5. I've always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come. I don’t do things half-heartedly. Because I know if I do, then I can expect half-hearted results. —Michael Jordan
    
 6. Be so good they can't ignore you. —Steve Martin
 
 7. Volleyball rules are simple. If it is on the floor, pick it up and get it into the air. If it is in the air, keep it off the floor. —John Kessel
